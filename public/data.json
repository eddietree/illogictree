But due to the geometric complexity of grass, rendering it realistically in real-time can be difficult and computationally expensive. Furthermore, to produce life-like representations of grass requires faithful physical simulations of movement provided by wind currents. My <strong>master’s thesis</strong> is all about discovering and implementing real-time grass.</p>",
